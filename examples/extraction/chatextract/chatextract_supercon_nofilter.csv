Adrian Institut fiir Festkorperphysik, Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, Hochschulstrasse 8, D 6428-9Darmstadt, Germany (Received 28 February 1994) The anisotropy of the high-temperature superconductors has strong impact on their transport proper- ties in the mixed state. We have performed a comparative study of the Nernst, Seebeck, and Hall effects of the anisotropic and extremely anisotropic high-temperature superconductors YBazCu307 q and BizSrzCaCuz08+„, respectively."

The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal MoSn4-type structure (space group I41/acd) and exhibits superconductivity below Tc = 0.9 ± 0.05 K. Further, the magnitude of the ratios 1Cp/(γnkBTc) = 1.29, 21/(kBTc) = 3.55 and of the electron–phonon coupling λe−ph = 0.5 imply that superconductivity in β-IrSn4 can be ascribed to a s-wave weak coupling regime."

Paper_2,β-IrSn4,common name of structure,None,None,Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter PAPER Observation of superconductivity in the Discussion and conclusions The ﬁrst picture which emerges from our measurements on single crystals of β-IrSn4 is that this binary intermetallic compound becomes superconducting below 0.9 ± 0.05 K. The zero-ﬁeld data listed in table 1 are in accordance with the conventional s-wave singlet pairing mechanism and would also provide a hint of either the type-I or type-II/1 superconductivity with a weak electron–phonon coupling. In order to get insight into the physics underlying the superconductivity in β-IrSn4 we can discuss several factors which would be involved in the Cooper pairing mechanism: (i) anisotropy of the Fermi surface and (ii) electron correlations.

The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal MoSn4-type structure (space group I41/acd) and exhibits superconductivity below Tc = 0.9 ± 0.05 K. Further, the magnitude of the ratios 1Cp/(γnkBTc) = 1.29, 21/(kBTc) = 3.55 and of the electron–phonon coupling λe−ph = 0.5 imply that superconductivity in β-IrSn4 can be ascribed to a s-wave weak coupling regime."

The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal MoSn4-type structure (space group I41/acd) and exhibits superconductivity below Tc = 0.9 ± 0.05 K. Further, the magnitude of the ratios 1Cp/(γnkBTc) = 1.29, 21/(kBTc) = 3.55 and of the electron–phonon coupling λe−ph = 0.5 imply that superconductivity in β-IrSn4 can be ascribed to a s-wave weak coupling regime."

However, the substitution effect alone is not sufﬁcient to induce superconductivity at low temperature, and an additional external pressure has to be applied, with appearance of the superconducting state at '3 GPa for the ~Sr0.4 , Ca13.6!Cu24O41 compound, which corre- sponds to a cell parameter b'12.15 Å."

Taking the slope of µ0Hc2(T) in the temperature range 0.63–0.94 K, dµ0Hc2(T)/dT = −9.83 mT K−1, and the orbital-limiting ﬁeld relation µ0Horb c2 = 0.73Tc(0)[−dµ0Hc2(T)/dT]Tc for a clean limit superconductor, we obtain µ0Horb c2 = 8.1 mT for Tc(0) = 1.13 K. It appears that all observed values of the critical ﬁelds are small and certainly indicate the absence of the Pauli limiting ﬁeld µ0Hp = 1.86Tc, which is of the order of ∼2 T.

In most cuprates, for instance, La22xSrxCuO4, underdoped YBa2Cu3O61x, Bi2Sr2CuOy, the “metal-like” electron transport along CuO2 planes coexists with a nonmetal- lic conductivity between planes, and the resistivity anisotropy, rcyrab, diverges with decreasing temperature till the superconducting transition interrupts this tendency [1–3]."

For the sample with x ø 0.41, rc monotonically decreases within a wide temperature range from 127 K down to Tc ø 19 K. A tendency of rc to saturate is apparent for x ø 0.49 as well, but for such and higher doping levels the rc crossover is masked, because Tm quickly decreases with doping, while superconductivity in its turn hides the larger temperature range."

The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal MoSn4-type structure (space group I41/acd) and exhibits superconductivity below Tc = 0.9 ± 0.05 K. Further, the magnitude of the ratios 1Cp/(γnkBTc) = 1.29, 21/(kBTc) = 3.55 and of the electron–phonon coupling λe−ph = 0.5 imply that superconductivity in β-IrSn4 can be ascribed to a s-wave weak coupling regime."

Paper_8,Re24Ti5,measuring temperature,5.8,K,"Superconductor Science and Technology PAPER According to our Ce(T) analysis, Re24Ti5 is better described as an ordinary s-wave superconductor, indicating that a mixture of the spin singlet and triplet states in the SC phase driven by the ASOC effect is invisible. This result is likely due to a small band splitting lifted by ASOC as compared to the transition temperature Tc ≃5.8 K for Re24Ti5."

For the sample with x ø 0.41, rc monotonically decreases within a wide temperature range from 127 K down to Tc ø 19 K. A tendency of rc to saturate is apparent for x ø 0.49 as well, but for such and higher doping levels the rc crossover is masked, because Tm quickly decreases with doping, while superconductivity in its turn hides the larger temperature range."

N. Lavrov,* M. Yu. Kameneva, and L. P. Kozeeva In the RBa2Cu3O61x system, superconductivity mostly hides the low-T region and the normal-state resistiv- ity can be measured down to fairly low temperatures only in a narrow doping range in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic-superconducting (AFM-SC) phase boundary. For the sample with x ø 0.41, rc monotonically decreases within a wide temperature range from 127 K down to Tc ø 19 K. A tendency of rc to saturate is apparent for x ø 0.49 as well, but for such and higher doping levels the rc crossover is masked, because Tm quickly decreases with doping, while superconductivity in its turn hides the larger temperature range."

We also show that the trapped Aux due to intergrain weak-link and intragrain Aux pinning is negligible in our samples, and that the Meissner fractions for the samples with the same ' 0 isotope are nearly equal The observed large oxygen isotope efFects on T, and the Meissner fraction can be explained as due to the oxygen-mass dependence of m (efTective mass of carriers)."

Taking the slope of µ0Hc2(T) in the temperature range 0.63–0.94 K, dµ0Hc2(T)/dT = −9.83 mT K−1, and the orbital-limiting ﬁeld relation µ0Horb c2 = 0.73Tc(0)[−dµ0Hc2(T)/dT]Tc for a clean limit superconductor, we obtain µ0Horb c2 = 8.1 mT for Tc(0) = 1.13 K. It appears that all observed values of the critical ﬁelds are small and certainly indicate the absence of the Pauli limiting ﬁeld µ0Hp = 1.86Tc, which is of the order of ∼2 T. In order to support the dominant orbital-pair breaking effect we determined the value of the Maki parameter [20, 21], αM = (3e2¯hγVρ0)/(2π2k2 Bme) = 5.4 × 10−3."

The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal MoSn4-type structure (space group I41/acd) and exhibits superconductivity below Tc = 0.9 ± 0.05 K. Further, the magnitude of the ratios 1Cp/(γnkBTc) = 1.29, 21/(kBTc) = 3.55 and of the electron–phonon coupling λe−ph = 0.5 imply that superconductivity in β-IrSn4 can be ascribed to a s-wave weak coupling regime."
