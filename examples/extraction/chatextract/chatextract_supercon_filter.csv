Cava The effect of applied pressure and lattice anomaly on the physical and superconducting properties of the (Sr142x ,M x)Cu24O41 compounds may be discussed on the basis of the present results and already reported structural and physical measurements.5–7 The main effect of the sub- stitution of Ca for Sr and of applied pressure is a strong decrease of the b cell parameter, which corresponds to an increased coupling between the ladder and chain layers, and to a charge transfer from the chains to the ladders. However, the substitution effect alone is not sufﬁcient to induce superconductivity at low temperature, and an additional external pressure has to be applied, with appearance of the superconducting state at '3 GPa for the ~Sr0.4 , Ca13.6!Cu24O41 compound, which corre- sponds to a cell parameter b'12.15 Å."

The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal MoSn4-type structure (space group I41/acd) and exhibits superconductivity below Tc = 0.9 ± 0.05 K. Further, the magnitude of the ratios 1Cp/(γnkBTc) = 1.29, 21/(kBTc) = 3.55 and of the electron–phonon coupling λe−ph = 0.5 imply that superconductivity in β-IrSn4 can be ascribed to a s-wave weak coupling regime."

However, the substitution effect alone is not sufﬁcient to induce superconductivity at low temperature, and an additional external pressure has to be applied, with appearance of the superconducting state at '3 GPa for the ~Sr0.4 , Ca13.6!Cu24O41 compound, which corre- sponds to a cell parameter b'12.15 Å."
