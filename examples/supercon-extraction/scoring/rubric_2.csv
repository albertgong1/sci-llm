A/(N/m²) or A·m²/N

Breaking this down:
- Gigapascal (GPa) is a unit of pressure, with 1 GPa = 10⁹ Pa
- Pascal (Pa) in SI base units is N/m² (newtons per square meter)

So if the equivalent unit is A/GPa, the SI unit would be A/(10⁹ N/m²) or 10⁻⁹ A·m²/N.

The proper SI unit would therefore be ampere square meter per newton (A·m²/N), though you would typically need to include the factor of 10⁻⁹ when converting from A/GPa.",ohm.m,temperature dependence of LATB
