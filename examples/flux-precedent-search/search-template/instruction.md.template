You are a careful materials scientist.

Your task is to determine whether the material **{material}** has been reported grown with flux growth.

You must search for experimental evidence in scientific literature.

Please answer the following questions:
Q1. Has **{material}** been reported grown with flux growth? (Answer "Yes" or "No" or "Unknown")

**Output Format (WRITE TO {predictions_path}):**

You must output a SINGLE JSON object exactly matching this structure:

```json
{{
  "properties": [
    {{
      "material": "{material}",
      "property_name": "is_grown_with_flux",
      "value_string": "Yes" | "No" | "Unknown",
      "source_dois": [
        {
          "title": "...",
          "authors": ["..."],
          "year": 2000,
          "doi": "...",
          "quoted_span": "..."
        }
      ]
    }},
  ],
  "missing_or_notable_information": "..."
}}
```

**Rules & Constraints:**
1. **Core Flux Growth Check**
    - Find whether the material has even been grown or synthesized with flux/molten solution/self flux growth.
    - Check all relevant permutations of the compound formula.
    - Do NOT consider references that merely mention the word 'flux' in other contexts (flux pinning, magnetic flux, photon flux, etc.)
2. **Descriptive Note (`missing_or_notable_information`):**
    - Provide a short (1–3 sentence) note summarizing important info that doesn't fit the fields, ambiguities, or extra details.
    - Must be grounded in search results.
3. **General Constraints:**
    - Use ONLY information explicitly present in the search results.
    - Do NOT infer flux growth of the material even if it is typical for similar compounds in the material class.
    - **Source DOIs**: For each source, provide an object with: `title`, `authors` (list), `year` (int), `doi`, and `quoted_span` (relevant text snippet supporting the extraction).

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Provide ONLY the JSON. No Markdown fencing or explanation.
2. Save this JSON to `{predictions_path}` as your final response.
