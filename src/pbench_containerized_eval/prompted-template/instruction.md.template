{paper_at_command}

You are given the following paper (refno: {refno}).

Task metadata (structured questions): {meta_path}

Agent tips:
- Gemini CLI supports At commands, e.g. {gemini_at_commands}
- Claude Code can read files from disk (e.g. {claude_file_examples}) or use terminal tools.

You will be provided questions about extracting a material property from the paper.
Your task is to provide an answer according to these instructions:
- Identify the material by its chemical formula or name
- Locate the property name, value, and unit in the text
- Ensure the property value corresponds to the correct material
- Extract exact values as they appear in the paper
- If a property is not found, set `pred_value` to `NOT_FOUND` and `pred_unit` to `N/A`
- DO NOT include any additional information beyond the requested format.

Output format:
- Produce a JSON array (no prose) with one entry per question, in the same order as listed:

[
  {{"material": "...", "property_name": "...", "pred_value": "...", "pred_unit": "..."}},
  ...
]

Print ONLY this JSON array as your final response. If you can write to disk, also save
it to {predictions_path} with the same structure.

Questions:
{question_blocks}

Important:
- Some papers may contain multiple rows with the same material + property_name but different values.
  Do NOT deduplicate; output one JSON entry per question, in order.
