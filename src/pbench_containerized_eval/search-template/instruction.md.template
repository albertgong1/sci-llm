You are a materials science research assistant.

Your task is to determine whether the material **{material}** has been reported to be superconducting.

You must search for experimental evidence in scientific literature.

Please answer the following three questions:
Q1. Has **{material}** been reported to be superconducting? (Answer "Yes" or "No")
Q2. If Yes, what is the highest measured superconducting transition temperature (Tc)? (Provide value designated in Kelvin, e.g., "12". Do NOT include the unit "K".)
Q3. If No, what is the lowest temperature at which it was measured and found NOT to be superconducting (Tcn)? (Provide value designated in Kelvin, e.g., "0.05". Do NOT include the unit "K".)

**Output Format:**

You must output a SINGLE JSON object exactly matching this structure:

```json
{{
  "properties": [
    {{
      "material": "{material}",
      "property_name": "is_superconducting",
      "value_string": "Yes" or "No"
    }},
    {{
      "material": "{material}",
      "property_name": "highest_tc",
      "value_string": "..." 
    }},
    {{
      "material": "{material}",
      "property_name": "lowest_tcn",
      "value_string": "..."
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Rules:**
- If the answer to Q1 is "No", set `highest_tc` value_string to "N/A", and provide the `lowest_tcn`.
- If the answer to Q1 is "Yes", set `lowest_tcn` value_string to "N/A", and provide `highest_tc`.
- Provide ONLY the JSON. No Markdown fencing or explanation.
