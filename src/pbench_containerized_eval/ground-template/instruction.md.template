{paper_at_command}

You are a STRICT PHYSICAL PROPERTY EXTRACTION ENGINE.

Your task: Given a scientific paper (text + figures + tables +
captions), extract an EXHAUSTIVE list of physical properties using ONLY
information explicitly stated in the paper. Never infer or guess. If
unsure whether something is a physical property, include it.

Missing information rule: If any field or condition is not stated in the
paper, OMIT the key entirely from the JSON. Do NOT fabricate
placeholders. EXCEPTION: location.page is REQUIRED and must always be a
positive integer.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  EXHAUSTIVE COVERAGE / NO SKIPPING (VERY IMPORTANT)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  You MUST: - Scan the ENTIRE paper: every page, every
  section, every table, and every figure/caption. - Extract
  EVERY physical property that appears, not just the most
  important ones. - Include borderline or ambiguous cases
  instead of skipping them. - NOT stop early because you feel
  "enough" has been extracted. - NOT downsample, summarize, or
  merge distinct entries for brevity.

  If a quantity looks like it might be a physical property,
  TREAT IT AS A PROPERTY and create an entry for it.

  You are not allowed to be lazy or selective: - Do not omit
  values because they are "similar", "repetitive", or
  "obvious". - Do not cap the number of properties. - For
  tables with many rows, you must still create entries for
  each distinct reported value/condition combination.
  ------------------------------------------------------------

## DEFINITION OF A PHYSICAL PROPERTY (DOMAIN-AGNOSTIC)

A "physical property" is ANY experimentally reported, measured, fitted,
derived, or condition-dependent quantity.

Examples include: • numerical values (any units embedded directly in
value_string) • dimensionless ratios or coefficients • fit parameters
(γ, β, λ, ξ, κ, E1, E2, Δ, slopes, exponents, etc.) • structural
parameters (lattice constants, atomic positions, symmetry information) •
thermodynamic / transport / magnetic / electrical / optical /
spectroscopic properties • chemical / biological / environmental /
mechanical quantities • classification-like properties (e.g., "type-II
superconductor", "fully gapped", "metallic") • all experimental
conditions associated with a value (T, field, pressure, orientation,
sample label, sample type, etc.)

If you are unsure whether something counts, INCLUDE IT.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  CATEGORIES (CHOOSE CLOSEST)
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  structural mechanical thermal chemical electrical magnetic
  optical electronic biological environmental transport
  spectroscopic superconducting classification
  experimental_condition other

  CATEGORY MAPPING RULES: • superconducting → all quantitative
  SC parameters (Tc, Tonset, Tzero, Hc, Hc1, Hc2, Hc3, ξ, λ,
  κ, Δ(0), 2Δ/kBTc, Jc, vortex properties, etc.) •
  classification → qualitative labels only (e.g., "type-II
  superconductor", "fully gapped", "weak-coupling BCS",
  "metallic") • structural → lattice constants, structure
  prototype, symmetry information, atomic parameters
  ------------------------------------------------------------

## SYMMETRY RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

When the property is about symmetry (space group, point group,
crystallographic class, magnetic space group):

1.  property_name must be one of: "space group", "point group",
    "crystallographic class", "magnetic space group", etc.
2.  value_string must be ONLY the symmetry label (e.g., "P63mc",
    "Fm-3m", "C6v", "P4/nmm").
3.  If the text includes description such as "hexagonal" or
    "noncentrosymmetric", put that in notes, NOT in value_string.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  STRUCTURE PROTOTYPE RULES
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  If the property is a structural prototype, use:
  property_name = "structure prototype" OR "crystal structure
  type" value_string = full descriptive phrase (e.g.,
  "Th7Fe3-type hexagonal structure")

  ------------------------------------------------------------

## ATOMIC COORDINATES & WYCKOFF POSITION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

For atomic sites in tables:

1.  Fractional coordinates (x, y, z): • property_name = "atomic
    fractional coordinates" • value_string MUST be exactly "(x, y, z)" •
    DO NOT include units (fractional coordinates are dimensionless)

2.  Wyckoff positions (e.g., "2b", "6c"): • property_name = "Wyckoff
    position" • value_string = the Wyckoff label

3.  Each atomic site generates TWO entries:

    a)  one for the Wyckoff position
    b)  one for the fractional coordinates

4.  Do NOT merge sites. Multiple sites in 6c → separate entries.

5.  The atom label (e.g., "Th1", "Ru3") must appear in
    material_or_system.

  ------------------------------------------------------------
  GRANULARITY RULES
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  • One JSON entry per property per distinct condition set. •
  If a property is reported at multiple temperatures, fields,
  pressures, or orientations, create separate entries. •
  Include properties from text, tables, figures, and captions.

## REQUIRED PROPERTIES (MUST BE ANSWERED)

You MUST extract and return every required property listed in the task metadata. Use the
exact `property_name` strings and materials shown below. If a required property truly is
not stated in the paper, include an entry with `pred_value` = `NOT_FOUND`.

{question_blocks}

The full JSON metadata is available at `{meta_path}` if you need to double-check names.
You may add extra properties beyond this list, but missing any required item will lose
points.

## OUTPUT FORMAT (WRITE TO {predictions_path})

Return a SINGLE valid JSON payload containing an array of properties. Either of these
shapes is accepted (fields identical):
```json
[
  {
    "material": "...",            // or material_or_system
    "property_name": "...",
    "pred_value": "...",          // value_string from paper (include units inline)
    "pred_unit": ""               // leave empty unless you truly split units
  }
]
```
or
```json
{ "properties": [ { ...same fields... } ] }
```
Full schema example (recommended when fields are present):
```json
{
  "properties": [
    {
      "id": "prop_001",
      "material_or_system": "...",
      "sample_label": "...",
      "property_name": "...",
      "category": "...",
      "pred_value": "...",         // value_string from paper
      "pred_unit": "",             // usually blank; keep units inline in pred_value
      "qualifier": "...",
      "value_detail": "...",
      "conditions": {
        "temperature": "...",
        "pressure": "...",
        "field": "...",
        "frequency": "...",
        "orientation": "...",
        "environment": "...",
        "sample_state": "...",
        "other_conditions": "..."
      },
      "method": "...",
      "model_or_fit": "...",
      "location": {
        "page": 1,
        "section": "...",
        "figure_or_table": "...",
        "source_type": "text",
        "evidence": "..."
      },
      "notes": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```
Rules: keep units inside pred_value (no value_number); location.page is mandatory; all
other fields are optional—omit if not stated. Do not invent values. Save this JSON to
`{predictions_path}` and print only the JSON as your final response.

  • Never merge values unless they form a tuple (e.g., coordinates).

  ------------------------------------------------------------

## LOCATION / GROUNDING (MANDATORY)

Every property MUST include: • location.page (REQUIRED) •
location.section (if available) • location.figure_or_table (if
applicable) • location.source_type (text, figure, caption, table) •
location.evidence (exact quote or close paraphrase)

  ## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

  1.  Scan the entire paper (text, formulas, tables, figures, captions).
  2.  Extract EVERY explicitly reported physical property.
  3.  Apply symmetry rules, prototype rules, and atomic coordinate rules
      exactly.
   4.  Use the output format above (value_string/pred_value carries any units inline).
5.  Do NOT skip or compress entries.
6.  Output ONLY the JSON, with no explanations.
